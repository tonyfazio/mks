        <h1>Hipster</h1>
        <h2>By Faz</h2>
        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>In a Huffington Post article entitled "Who's a Hipster?", Julia Plevin argues that the "definition of 'hipster' remains opaque to anyone outside this self-proclaiming, highly-selective circle." In Rob Horning's April 2009 article "The Death of the Hipster" in PopMatters, he states that the hipster might be the "embodiment of postmodernism as a spent force, revealing what happens when pastiche and irony exhaust themselves as aesthetics." In a New York Times editorial, Mark Greif states that the much-cited difficulty in analyzing the term stems from the fact that any attempt to do so provokes universal anxiety, since it "calls everyone's bluff".</p>
        <h1>What the Heck is a Hipster?</h1>
        <p>Hipsters are the friends who sneer when you cop to liking Coldplay. They're the people who wear t-shirts silk-screened with quotes from movies you've never heard of and the only ones in America who still think Pabst Blue Ribbon is a good beer. They sport cowboy hats and berets and think <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subculture">Kanye West</a> stole their sunglasses. Everything about them is exactingly constructed to give off the vibe that they just don't care.</p>
